This is my first project using web scrapping after completing mit open course Introduction to Computer Science with Python.
I don't intend to continue on the path of data analysis, which is why I only learned the general concept of web scrapping
using pandas and beautifulsoup to create a computer price comparison that creates an excel table with all the "cheaper products"from one of the two websites.
